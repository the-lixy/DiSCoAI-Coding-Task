# DiSCoAI-Coding-Task
My code has been completed as a Streamlit application in Google Colab. I chose the SpaCy library as its PhraseMatcher class was very suitable for lightweight dialogue classification. My code contains lists of common phrases and syntax that appear in different functions of dialogue and counts the matches for a given line of dialogue. It is extremely lightweight but the drawback is that some phrases may not be accounted for, or would struggle on less formal dialogue which may be more subtextual or require surrounding context to determine meaning.<br><br>
I chose to use OpenAI's GPT-4o mini as it is one of the most popular LLMs right now and ranks very highly on Artificial Analysis' leaderboard while also being affordable. (Source: https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models). <br>
My code connects to GPT-4o mini via the OpenAI API. API keys can be generated from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. An account with credit is required. <br><br>
For best results, please open and run the notebook in Colab. It uses LocalTunnel to be able to open the Streamlit application through Colab. Sometimes LocalTunnel requires a password to prevent abuse, the password is provided in the Colab file. Sometimes on a first visit the Streamlit page does not load, please try refreshing if this happens.
